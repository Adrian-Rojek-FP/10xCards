  "source_text": "TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor. TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps. TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give you great tooling without additional code. All valid JavaScript code is also TypeScript code. You might get type-checking errors, but that won't stop you from running the resulting JavaScript. While you can go for stricter behavior, that means you're still in control. TypeScript's types are completely erased by compilation. There is no TypeScript runtime. The program's behavior is the same regardless of whether it was written in TypeScript or JavaScript. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning that every JavaScript file is a valid TypeScript file. TypeScript extends JavaScript by adding types, enabling IDEs to provide a richer environment for spotting common errors as you type the code."
