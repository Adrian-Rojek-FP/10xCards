  "source_text": "JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it. As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O. JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other software systems, most notably servers and a variety of applications. Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design. JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997. After that, ECMAScript is the name for the language specification, and JavaScript is the most well-known implementation of the specification. Other implementations include JScript and ActionScript. JavaScript is usually embedded directly into HTML pages and is interpreted by the web browser. This means that a web page need not be a static HTML file, but can include programs that interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content. The client-side JavaScript framework enables developers to build single-page applications (SPAs) that can update the user interface without requiring a full page reload from the server. Popular JavaScript frameworks include React, Angular, and Vue.js. On the server side, Node.js has become a popular platform for building scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices."
