# Pull Request Workflow - Implementation Summary

## 📋 Overview

Successfully implemented a new GitHub Actions workflow (`pull-request.yml`) that validates pull requests with comprehensive testing and automated status reporting.

## ✅ What Was Created

### 1. **New Workflow File**: `.github/workflows/pull-request.yml`

A complete PR validation workflow with the following structure:

```
Lint ──┬──> Unit Tests ──┐
       │                 ├──> Status Comment (Success only)
       └──> E2E Tests ───┘
```

### 2. **Workflow Documentation**: `.github/workflows/README-pull-request.md`

Comprehensive documentation covering:
- Workflow architecture and job dependencies
- Required secrets and environment configuration
- Troubleshooting guides
- Action version tracking
- Best practices

### 3. **Configuration Update**: `vitest.config.ts`

Added `json-summary` reporter to coverage configuration for automated coverage reporting in PR comments.

### 4. **Main Workflow README Update**: `.github/workflows/README.md`

Updated to reference the new pull request workflow.

## 🔧 Workflow Features

### Jobs Breakdown

#### 1. **Lint** (5 min timeout)
- Validates code quality using ESLint
- Runs first as a gate for all other jobs
- Uses Node.js from `.nvmrc` (v22.14.0)

#### 2. **Unit Tests** (10 min timeout) - Parallel with E2E
- Depends on: Lint
- Runs Vitest with coverage reporting
- Uploads coverage to Codecov (optional)
- Generates `coverage-summary.json` for PR comment
- Artifacts retained for 7 days

#### 3. **E2E Tests** (15 min timeout) - Parallel with Unit Tests
- Depends on: Lint
- Environment: `integration`
- Installs Playwright Chromium browser only
- Runs full application build before testing
- Uploads Playwright reports and test results
- Uses comprehensive environment variables

#### 4. **Status Comment** (5 min timeout)
- Depends on: All previous jobs (must succeed)
- Condition: `if: success()`
- Downloads all test artifacts
- Generates comprehensive PR comment with:
  - ✅ Success status
  - 📊 Coverage statistics (unit + E2E)
  - 🔗 Links to workflow runs
  - 📦 Build information
- Creates or updates existing bot comment

## 🔐 Required Configuration

### GitHub Secrets (Repository Level)

| Secret | Required | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | ✅ Yes | Supabase project URL (client & server) |
| `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY` | ✅ Yes | Supabase anon key (client & server) |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | ❌ Optional | OpenRouter API for AI features |
| `CODECOV_TOKEN` | ❌ Optional | Codecov upload (private repos) |

### GitHub Environment: `integration`

Create environment with same secrets as above:
1. Repository → Settings → Environments
2. New environment: `integration`
3. Add secrets listed above

## 📊 Action Versions (All Up-to-Date)

| Action | Version | Verified |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `actions/checkout` | v5 | ✅ Oct 2025 |
| `actions/setup-node` | v6 | ✅ Oct 2025 |
| `actions/upload-artifact` | v4 | ✅ Oct 2025 |
| `actions/download-artifact` | v5 | ✅ Oct 2025 |
| `actions/github-script` | v8 | ✅ Oct 2025 |
| `codecov/codecov-action` | v5 | ✅ Oct 2025 |

All actions verified as:
- Not archived
- Using latest major versions
- Following recommended practices

## 🎯 Workflow Triggers

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
```

## 🔒 Permissions

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read          # Read repository files
  actions: read           # Read workflow information
  checks: write           # Write check run status
  pull-requests: write    # Post comments on PRs
```

## ⚡ Performance Features

1. **Parallel Execution**: Unit and E2E tests run simultaneously after lint
2. **Concurrency Control**: Cancels outdated runs per PR
3. **Efficient Caching**: npm cache via `actions/setup-node`
4. **Artifact Sharing**: Coverage and reports shared across jobs
5. **Smart Timeouts**: Optimized per job complexity

## 📝 PR Comment Example

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Coverage collected with Vitest
- Reports: text, json, json-summary, html
- Excludes: node_modules, dist, tests, *.d.ts, *.config.*

### E2E Tests
- Playwright with Chromium only
- Runs against built application
- Full integration environment
- Screenshot on failure
- Video on retry
- Trace on first retry

## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Enable This Workflow:

1. **Configure GitHub Secrets**
   ```bash
   # Go to: Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   # Add the required secrets listed above
   ```

2. **Create Integration Environment**
   ```bash
   # Go to: Repository → Settings → Environments
   # Create 'integration' environment with same secrets
   ```

3. **Optional: Setup Codecov**
   ```bash
   # For private repos, add CODECOV_TOKEN secret
   # Get token from: https://codecov.io
   ```

4. **Test the Workflow**
   ```bash
   # Create a test PR to main branch
   # Verify all jobs complete successfully
   # Check PR comment is posted
   ```

## 📊 Comparison with CI Workflow

| Feature | `ci.yml` | `pull-request.yml` |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **Trigger** | Push to main | Pull requests |
| **Coverage** | No upload | Codecov + artifacts |
| **PR Comments** | No | Yes ✅ |
| **Environment** | Production | Integration |
| **Parallel Tests** | Partial | Full (unit + E2E) |
| **Build Step** | Separate job | Integrated in E2E |

Both workflows can coexist and complement each other for comprehensive CI/CD.
